- check (and fix  if needed) "for dict_stock in stocks_for_action:"-part (make sure loops)
- Fix isMaxStockHeldAndActive() (getCurrentNumberOfStocksHeld, maybe more, returns 0)

- Use Stop-Loss
- Record OMX daily percent change for reference in Order Statistics?
- Ensure stock has been sold at sell order

- På sikt: prova blankning?
